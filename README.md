## ‚úèÔ∏è Project Description

Libry is an application that allows the user to search for books and see its informations like: title, author, page count, etc. Also, if the user signs in with their Google account, they can add or remove books from their bookshelf.

<br />

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies

- ### TypeScript;

- ### React;

- ### NextJS;

- ### Redux;

- ### Stitches (CSS in JS library);

- ### Axios:

  I used Axios to consume Google Books API.

- ### Firebase:

  I used Firebase Firestore for the database - the users bookshelves are saved in the database - and Firebase Auth for authentication - with Google provider.

<br />

## ü•á Features

The user can:
- Search for books;
- See books informations;
- If signed in, add/remove a book to their bookshelves: "To Read", "Reading" or "Read";
- Switch theme (dark mode or light mode).

<br />

## ‚è±Ô∏è Status

This project is finished.

<br />

## üí° Inspiration

I enjoy reading and got inspiration from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) and [Skoob](https://www.skoob.com.br/) - which are very useful apps for those who like to organize their readings - to create this project from scratch, and practice my skills with React, Redux, CSS in JS and Axios. Besides, I made it pretty responsive.
